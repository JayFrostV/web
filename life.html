    <p>According to Sinchew, Du celebrated her 42nd birthday on Saturday. Zhang thus created a floral path in the backyard, demonstrating his deep affection for his wife.

        "My wife always says I’m not romantic enough," the director wrote on social media. "Today I created a romantic scene for her and our children. Happy birthday to my wife."
        
        Zhang also revealed that his wife’s birthday marked their seventh wedding anniversary. He said he had secretly arranged the roses to see her reaction.
        
        Upon seeing thousands of roses arranged throughout the backyard, Du smiled and expressed her gratitude to her husband. Zhang then pushed a cake cart to her, and the couple cut the cake together before enjoying dessert.
        
        Zhang’s romantic gesture sparked lively discussions on social media, with topics such as the couple’s age gap, love, and happiness gaining traction.
        
        Since marrying Du in 2017, Zhang has consistently pampered her. In a previous interview, Du mentioned that he took meticulous care of her during her pregnancy when she experienced morning sickness.
        
        He accompanied her to every ultrasound appointment, observing the fetus and listening to the doctor’s explanation of the baby’s health. He carefully recorded the doctor’s recommendations and would stop work immediately whenever she needed him. Du also noted that he often provided foot massages and prepared fruit for her.
        
        Zhang is famous for his film adaptations of classic wuxia novels by esteemed author Jin Yong, including "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer," "The Legend of the Condor Heroes," "Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils," "The Return of the Condor Heroes," "Heavenly Sword and Dragon Saber," and "The Deer and the Cauldron."
        
        In addition to his directorial accomplishments, Zhang has played supporting roles in several of these adaptations.
        
        He and Du have recently gained popularity through their live streams, where they sell a variety of products.</p>
