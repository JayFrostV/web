        <p>With a runtime of 109 minutes, the finale of the hit Korean drama Queen Of Tears made every second of its earlier airtime on Sunday (Apr 28) count. We won't spoil what happens but you'd be wise to watch it ASAP because, as we predicted, a lot of people tuned in the catch the conclusion of Hyun-woo and Hae-in's love story.
            Queen Of Tears stars Kim Soo-hyun and Kim Ji-won, and follows the trials and tribulations of lawyer Baek Hyun-woo and his wife Hong Hae-in, the CEO of a department store who is diagnosed with brain cancer. It has won praise for its tragic themes and the chemistry between its two lead actors. 

            Following the finale, Queen Of Tears will air two special episodes on May 4 and 5 in which the cast members of the show will discuss key moments from the drama.

            How many people, exactly?
            Enough to officially dethrone 2019's Crash Landing On You as South Korean TV channel tvN's highest rated drama of all time.
            On Apr 29, rating research company Nielsen Korea announced that Queen Of Tears' final episode earned a viewership rating of 24.850 per cent across South Korea. With this, the show smashed the four-year record held by Crash Landing On You which scored a viewership rating of 21.683 for its finale.

            The news also marks another feather in the cap for award-winning screenwriter Park Ji-eun who wrote both Queen Of Tears and Crash Landing On You.
